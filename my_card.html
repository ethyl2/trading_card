			<p id="interesting-fact">Yeast love eating sugar in a warm, moist environment. They are very helpful in making bread and other foods.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Saccharomyces cerevisiae</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 5–10 μm in diameter</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: Depends on environmental conditions and temperature</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: They are found in the wild growing on grapes and other fruits. They can be cultivated in liquid media or on a nutrient surface.</li>

			<p>Yeast has been used since ancient Egyptians first figured out how to use them to make wine and bread.
         In making bread, the yeast eat sugar, and carbon dioxide is a byproduct (in a process called fermentation), which creates holes in the bread.
         Yeast divide by budding -- a small bud emerges from the surface of the parent and enlarges until it is almost the same size.
         They are also helpful in scientific research. In fact,
         <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> was the first organism to have its genome (its DNA sequence) fully sequenced.</p>
